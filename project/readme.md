# How to run code
We use python version 3. Please adjust command to your environment.
```
python3 linear_regression.py ./data/data.txt 300
```
Where './data/data.txt' is the path to the data and '300' is the number of iterations you would like to do.
The program can be adjusted in the code to run it with different feature selections. See code for further explanation.
## Requirements to run
numpy and matplotlib installed. These are not required by the model to run so the code can be adjusted to remove these requirements without breaking the linear regression model itself.
